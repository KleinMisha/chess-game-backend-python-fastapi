# Chess game backend 

## Learning goals
Learn how to create a full-stack application.
To achieve this, I will make my own multiplayer chess game. I will use this as an opportunity to separately create a backend and frontend, and eventually make multiple versions in different programming languages. 

**In this repository**
- **backend** - **Python** 
- Learn how to use fastAPI to create REST API.
- Learn how to make a very simple (in memory) SQL database using sqlalchemy
- This backend will handle calculating the 'state' of a chess game. That is, it will produce all information needed for any frontend application to create the view for the user to interact with.
